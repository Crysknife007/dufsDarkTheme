This is a dark theme I made for Dufs ( Distinctive utility file server ):

https://github.com/sigoden/dufs

Everything is now monochromatic and dark. I've switched fonts to JetBrains Mono, and added some hover over effects on the icons and fields. 
The favicon has been updated and many other small tweaks and modifications have been made.

To use the theme run dufs with the --assets flag and point it to the assets folder above.

Example:

dufs --assets assets/
